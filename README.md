 - There are two versions of this analysis. One written in R (was written before I even knew Python). The other, in Python (much more organized and consise)

Analyze the classic Coupon Collectors Problem: 
 - The scenerio: A ice cream shop owner has started a new promotion, where the collection of coupons by the consumers could win them a vaction or a prize. For this scenerio, the coupons range from {1, ......,n}, where n is the number of consecutive coupons needed to collect, in order, to win a prize. For example, let n = 10. In order to win a prize, the costumer would need to collect the 
 set of coupons = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. For this scenerio, all coupons are considerded equally likely to optain.
